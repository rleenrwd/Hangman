# Hangman
## By Robert L. Norwood
A Python-based command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game. Players attempt to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displaying the current state of the word and the number of remaining attempts.

## 🎮 How to Play
The game selects a random word from a predefined list.

You will be prompted to guess a letter.

If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).

If the letter is not in the word, you lose an attempt.

The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

## 🚀 Features
Random Word Selection: The game selects a random word from a predefined list.

User Input Handling: Accepts and validates user input to ensure it's a single alphabetical character.

Game Feedback: Displays the current state of the word and the number of remaining attempts after each guess.

Game Over Conditions: The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when all attempts are used.
